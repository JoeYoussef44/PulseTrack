# Changelog

What happened, session by session. Newest first.

Not a git log — `git log` records *what* changed. This records *why*, what was
learned, and what was left undone, so a new session does not have to
reconstruct it from diffs.

## Session 1 — 2026-08-24 (Mon)

**Phases 0 → 3 complete.** Tier 1 ~50%. 8 commits, none containing a secret.

### Analysis, before any code

- Read all five official Capadev attachments plus the pre-existing planning
  document, and produced `.docs/01-challenge-analysis.md`.
- Validated the planning doc against the originals. It was broadly accurate,
  but had **three defects** that would have cost real time or marks:
  1. Its `If-None-Exist` strategy was unsafe on a shared FHIR server — an
     un-scoped MRN match can bind us to another candidate's resource, making
     every later `PUT` a 403.
  2. It never noticed that the supplied sample CSV references
     `MRN-1001/1002/1003`, which exist nowhere by default — so an evaluator's
     first upload would reject all ten rows and look broken.
  3. It treated the deadline as 7 days. The candidate email says "before
     Thursday", which is ~2.5 working days.
- Produced `.docs/02-project-overview.html` (published as an Artifact) and
  `PulseTrack-Project-Brief.pdf` — a visual brief for the walkthrough call.

### Phase 0 — repo and reconnaissance

- Moved the FHIR API key out of the planning doc into `.env`, redacted the
  original, and gitignored both before the first commit.
- Probed the live FHIR server read-only. **Three of my own assumptions were
  wrong**; all corrected in analysis §23 and summarised in `state.md` §6. The
  significant one: pagination `next` links point at an unreachable internal
  host, so following them as documented silently truncates every import.

### Phase 1 — schema, auth, deploy skeleton

- Prisma schema with the two constraints that carry the brief's guarantees:
  unique `(patientId, collectedDate, testCode)` and unique
  `(assessmentId, questionId)`.
- Migration applied to Neon (Postgres 17.11). Idempotent seed: one clinician
  plus `MRN-1001/1002/1003`.
- Auth.js v5, Credentials + JWT, three-layer authorization.
- **Deploy did not happen** — Vercel account blocked. This is a deviation from
  the plan's deploy-early strategy and carries real risk (see `state.md` B2).

### Phase 2 — patient management

- CRUD, search, validation. Verified against the real database that duplicate
  MRN is rejected by the index, dates round-trip without timezone drift, and
  case-insensitive search works.

### Phase 3 — assessment flow

- Token issue → email → public form → server-side scoring → history.
- Verified 12 security properties against the real database, including a
  **concurrent double-submit producing exactly one completion and eight
  answers, not sixteen**.

### Problems hit and how they were resolved

| Problem | Resolution |
|---|---|
| `create-next-app` refused the folder name (npm forbids capitals) | Scaffolded into a temp subdirectory and moved the files up |
| Prisma 7 removed `datasourceUrl` | Added `@prisma/adapter-pg` |
| Prisma init dumped `.agents/`, `.windsurf/`, `skills-lock.json` | Deleted — noise |
| Next 16 deprecated `middleware.ts` and rejected the destructured export | Migrated to `proxy.ts` with a real default export |
| Auth.js 500ing on every request | Read the server log rather than guessing: `UntrustedHost`. Added `trustHost: true` |
| Zod 4 renamed `errorMap` | Changed to `error` |
| Lint error: `Date.now()` during render | Moved the derivation into the service, so the two views share one implementation |
| Screenshot of the assessment page came back 404 | An empty shell variable, not a routing bug. Caught only because the screenshot was actually looked at |

### Left undone

- CSV importer (Phase 4) — not started.
- Dashboards and charts (Phase 5) — assessment table only, no charts.
- README — still the create-next-app default.
- Nothing pushed to GitHub; nothing deployed.
